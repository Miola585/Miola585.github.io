what_i_learned: |
  Today marks the beginning of another week. I would say that I got a lot done today. I read up on some mobilenetv2 articles, and began my first model training by increasing the batch size. Dr Pelumi came in to check on us today and to give us a run down of what will happen for the rest of this week. By the end of this week, we will be running our data to see if the efficiency has improved compared to last weeks data. Dr Pelumi also took us on a tour to see the rest of the labs in the CBEIS building, and we got to meet Dr Owolabi's co-researcher, and learn more about the lab as a whole

  My pc in the lab just shut down, but Dr. Pelumi said that he will fix it by tommorrow, that slowed things down a bit but my teammates were there to help.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a slow but productive day. I got to explore the various labs in cbeis so I wouldn't be sedentary for the entire day. I also got to begin training the model for mobilenetv2. Tommorow, I will try to add a learning rate, and also increase the epoch size to see if the confusion matrix improves or not. I will also be researching about ways to improve the model by searching up different weights and optimizers that will improved the accuracy.
