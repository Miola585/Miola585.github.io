what_i_learned: |
  Today was another eventful day in the research lab. My group and I had a meeting with our graduate mentor before we started to work. We discussed the research papers that we had read the previous day amongst ourselves, and we found a common issue regarding our research. We also discussed the machine and algorithm that we will be using over the next few weeks as well as the data we will work with. After the meeting, I continued working on the kaggle course that I had been asked to complete, and I mangaed to complete 2 more topics today in the deep learning course today. Two more to go!!!
  
blockers: |
  While completing my kaggle course, I ran into some issues running th code that had been assigned to me, however, I was able to resolve the issue by going back and looking over previous examples provided. 

reflection: |
  Overall, I would say that today was a really productive day, and I was able to catch a glimpse of what the work would be like in the upcoming weeks.
