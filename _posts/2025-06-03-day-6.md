what_i_learned: |
  Today during orientation, we learned about Computer Vision from Mr Andrew Kelly. We used goggletree building to train a computer model to recognize images and also tested it to make sure that it worked correctly. I learned about how Computer vision was teaching computers how to see the world the ways humans do. I also learned that computer vision has 4 main tasks: Image Classification, Object Detection, Object tracking, and Image segmentation.

  After the computer vision workshop session, I met with my group members and we were placed into an escape room to be able to communicate better. The name of the game was 'Enchambered: Alone Together'. We had to solve puzzles that we had on our respctive screens without knowing what the other members saw. It was stressful at first but eventually we got the hang of it and were able to escape the room after 30-45 minutes.

  Following the escape room activity, we returned to the main room to continue our Pytjon 102 courses. In this session, We were taught about reading and writing to files. It served as a refresher for the course 112, and it was intersting to learn about appending to files. I also learned that writing to a file will overrie any information that was in the file previously while appending would add new information to the file.

  When recording the data to train my CV model, I realized that I would not be able to be on the zoom camera while simultaneously trying to capture data.

  Overall, today was an impactful day as i got to learn new things, go over stuff i already knew, and bond with my fellow team members. Hopefully, I am able to apply this knowledge into upcoming projects that I will be working on.
