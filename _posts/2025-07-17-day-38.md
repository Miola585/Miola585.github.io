   Trying to write the lit paper. There's a lot to be implemented. It feels overwhelming. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we were able to make progress in the paper. I tried testing out the new dataset on the mobilenetv2 codebase today. Although the dataset isnt as diversified as the original one provide to us, it gives the model something new to train on. I'm trying to train it at least twice. The first result gave me a 91% average overall; to improve it, I unfroze the last 50 layers of the model to see if the accuracy would be higher. However, I will not be able to see the results until tommorow.
