  Today marked the continuation of the writing workshop from Dr. Pandey and the writing center here at Morgan. Dr. Pandey led us through an amazing session about how to write our body paragraphs. She also taught us essential delivery tips for the upcoming symposium. Following that w played a Kahoot reviewwing what we had learned in the past two weeks. With this bew teaching, I managed yo rewrite the literature review/related works section

   Trying to write the related works section of the paper. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, I got to learn more about presentation tips and how to make sure my presentation is more intereresting. I will be implementing what I have learned so far into my research paper. I was also able to run more models as this is going to be the last week to finalise it.
