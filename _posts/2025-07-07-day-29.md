what_i_learned: |
  Today was a pretty calm day at the lab. With the hustle and bustle of the mid-summer symposium finally settling down, there wasn't much to do today. I started the day by making my way to the lab. As i got settled in, I decided to run another model for MobileNetV2 and increeased the number of epochs iran to see if there would be any differences. At this moment, the model is giving suspiciously accurate results. With the measurement metrics at 100% throughout. Is suppose that is to be expected seeing as I utilized optuna and ran it for several days. Dr. Pleumi came to check up on us today and gave us the rundown for what we will be doing this week... begin writing our literature review. I began compling all the results that I have had over the past weeks to begin the data summary for mobilenetv2. I expect to be done with this by tomorrow.

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a relaxing day. The mid summer symposium on friday was very successful even though I was nervous at the beginning of the day. I was able to meet with my teammates briefly and we went over what each person would do on the presentation. Dr Pelumi assured us that we did well, and we will start to work on our literature review and the end of summer symposium
