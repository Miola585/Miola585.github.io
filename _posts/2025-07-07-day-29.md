  Nerve wrecking, Eye Opening, Clammy Hands, Stressful yet entertaining. These aree but few words that I can use to describe the events of today. When I got to the business school this morning, it was quiet. The sort of quiet that happens when there's anticipation; the lack of knowing who would go first for the Mid-Summer presentation. Of course the schedule was released 10 minutes later, and you could feel the collective sighs and groans echoing around the business school atrium. Going first, going last, presenting after lunch when people are tired and have sort of lost interest. That was the morning of the Mid-Summer Symposium for CEAMLS SAIRI 2025. How exciting.

  When I found out that my group would be going later after lunch, I calmed down a little, but at the same time I wanted to get the presentation over with. But this was a chance for us to refine our presentation as well as smooth things over to prevent any confusion when we would be presenting. As the time drew near for our presentation, I believe that's when the anxiety set in. My hands were clammy, my legs shook, but when i got up there, I was more confident with myself.

   At first I was nervous to present up there, but with the encouragement from my fellow cohort, it was less nervewrecking. 

reflection: |
    This morning, my Optuna model provided optimal learning and dropout rates, leading to impressive results with the Adam optimizer. I was excited to share these findings with my team, but the stress of editing our demo video quickly set in as we rushed to meet the deadline. Although we managed to submit it on time, our practice felt hurried, which made me a bit anxious. Despite this, I believe we are mostly prepared for tomorrow's presentation and can finalize any remaining details later.
