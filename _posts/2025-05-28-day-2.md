what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got to meet my faculty and graduate mentors. My group and I were separated into breakout rooms and met with our faculty mentor to be debriefed.

  I was told that I would have to complete the prework delieverables in the next two weeks in order to be able to understand what we would be doing over the next 8 weeks. 
  
  My graduate mentor, Pelumi Abiodun, told me that I would have to study about deep learning and computer vision from Kaggle. 

  After meeting with my mentors and group members, Mr Tandjong guided us to continue making our website and taught us how to make blog posts and editing the remainder of our website. 

  Following the website work,I was placed in Python 102,we then went on to different classes based on the placement test from yesterday. I was placed in Python 102, where we reviewed dictionary, sets, and lists. 
  
  It was a great refresher for what I had been taught during COSC 112. I also learned about hashing, which was new to me and quite fascinating.

reflection: |
  Overall, it was refreshing to have made progress on the website that we've been building together. It was also fun to meet my faculty and graduate mentors that i will be working with for the remainder of the summer. To wrap up the day, we played a game of Headbandz, which I had never played before. It was a fun way to end such an informative and engaging day.
