what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got to meet my faculty and graduate mentors. My group and I were separated into breakout rooms and met with our faculty mentor to be debriefed.

  I was told that I would have to complete the prework delieverables in the next two weeks in order to be able to understand what we would be doing over the next 8 weeks. My graduate mentor, Pelumi Abiodun, told me that I would have to study about deep learning and computer vision from Kaggle. 

  After meeting with my mentors and group members, Mr Tandjong guided us to continue making our website and taught us how to make blog posts and editing the remainder of our website.

  Overall, it was refreshing to have made progress on the website that we've been building together. I was also func to meet my faculty and graduate mentors that i will be working with for the remainder of the summer.
