what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got to meet my faculty and graduate mentors. My group and I were separated into breakout rooms and met with our faculty mentor to be debriefed.

  I was told that I would have to complete the prework delieverables in the next two weeks in order to be able to understand what we would be doing over the next 8 weeks. My graduate mentor, Pelumi Abiodun, told me that I would have to study about deep learning and computer vision from Kaggle. 

  After meeting with my mentors and group members, Mr Tandjong guided us to continue making our website and taught us how to make blog posts and editing the remainder of our website.

  The initial plots were noisy and hard to interpret. It turns out the electrodes weren’t making consistent contact. After adjusting electrode placements and grounding, the signals improved. I still need a more robust pipeline for removing motion artifacts and environmental noise.

  Seeing the filtered EEG patterns made the data feel much more real. I’m starting to see how crucial clean inputs are before even thinking about classification. Tomorrow, I’ll start prototyping a live attention monitor using thresholding on alpha power levels.
