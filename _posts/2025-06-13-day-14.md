what_i_learned: |
  Today marks the end of week . Dr Pelumi, my team members, and I went over our findings from Yesterday about each of the models that we had been researching. We discussed the features of mobileNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. We found that DenseNet was much more faster than the previous models, we also talked about the advantages and limitations of each of the models.

  We also discussed our project goals for the next week. Each person was assigned a model to train, as Dr. Pelumi said, We will be fine tuning, optimizing , and regularizing the model, and this might take a very long time. Since my introduction to overleaf, I have begun to transfer my literature summary from google docs to LaTex. I should be able to rewrite and complete it before the due date, next friday.

  I was assigned to work on MobileNetV2 and was told to change the epochs, the learning rate, and the batch sizes. I will be experimenting by changing the values to the listed variables, and see how well the model will change overtime. Following that I worked on my slide for the group video, and we were able to record it on zoom.

  Overall, this week has been very eventful, and I fee we were able to make a lot of progress on our project. I also learned a lot about the model that aI will be working with as i was able to watch yotube videos to go more into depth on the explanation of EfficientNet and DenseNet. I didn't really do much digging into mobileNet as that was our base code. I will look more into it next week since I am going to be in charge of fine tuning that model before we are placing it in the ensemble model.
