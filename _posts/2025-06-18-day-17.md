what_i_learned: |
  After I settled in, I began working on my models. I set up anaconda and jupyterwith the help of my lab partners to attempt to run the code locally, but i kept getting 404 errors. I was able to discuss this with Mr. Pelumi but unfortunately, I won't be able to run anything locally until the tech admin gets back. So I am stuck running on google colab's GPU/CPU. The training for the model has begun more in depth. I changed a few variables for the model such as, increasing the number of epochs. However, that didn't really yield results different from the previoud ones that I got. Dr Pelumi stated that we might have to try a different model if mobilenetv2 does not yield better results.

  The time for my GPU ran out so I had to start running the code on the CPU. It takes about 1 hour and 20 mins to run an epoch on my workstation PC, so I might have to run the model overnight. Hopefully there won't be any issues when i get here tommorow. I tried running the same code base on locally on Dr. Pelumi's worksattion using VSCode, and shockingly, the epoch only took 9 mins to run. Unfortunately, I won't be able to run it on my workstation  as I cannot access vscode without admin access. This problem should be resolved by next week.

  I also made a few changes to the model. I was able to implement early stopping by monitoring the loss value so it stops running if the loss increases if it was previously decreasing. I do not know the outcome of this yet, but i was also able to increase the number of epochs from 10 to 25 to see if there would be a difference. I should know by tommorow if nothing happen to the PC overnight. I was aslo able to do some reading on the types of callbacks and optimizers that keras has.

blockers: |
  Unable to run the code locally because i was getting a 404 error that i didn't understand.

reflection: |
  I would consider today a productive day. I am beginning to see the work come into fruition... somewhat. Although there have been a few blockers, which is normal because it shows where we need to make improvements. I hope that the issue with running the code locally will be resolved by the time the tech admin gets back. I was also able to learn more about various techniques to improve model training.
