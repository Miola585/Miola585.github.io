what_i_learned: |
  Today, Dr Pelumi came to check up on us and our progress regarding learning about the models so far. He then discussed our expectations for tommorow; run the densenet121 model as well as the efficientnet b0 model, we were also supposed to make the right changes in the code base to reflect which model we were training.

  I didn't know much about the other 2 models, efficientnet and densenet, but i was able to find videos on youtube that will properly explain them to me. I was able to complete the deep learning videos and i'm proud to say that I can understand concepts when my team members and mentros are discussing it. I also finished watching a video on the explanation of the densenet121, its architecture, and the advantages of it. I also changed the important code works to train the model, and complete training it before the end of the day. I was able to acheive okay results,as the model will need to be trained more. By tommorow, I will watch the videos on the explanation for efficient net and also train the model for it.

  I'm having trouble understanding efficientNet, but I will search up crash course videoss because those help me understand concepts better. I was also able to get screenshots from Yusrah

reflection: |
  I believe I was able to accomplish a lot today. I completed the crash course video for deep learning and also computer vision and was able to understand th
