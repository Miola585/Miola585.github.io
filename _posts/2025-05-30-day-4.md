what_i_learned: |
  As soon as the day began, we were sent out to breakout rooms where we continued to learn about Python 102. My group and I worked on various exercises. We worked on labs to crate text files that would store weather logs for different cities by adding them to a dictionary.
  

  
blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Overall, it was refreshing to have made progress on the website that we've been building together. 
  It was also fun to meet my faculty and graduate mentors that i will be working with for the remainder of the summer. 
  To wrap up the day, we played a game of Headbandz, which I had never played before. It was a fun way to end such an informative and engaging day.
