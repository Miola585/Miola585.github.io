what_i_learned: |
  As soon as the day began, we were sent out to breakout rooms where we continued to learn about Python 102. My group and I worked on various exercises. We worked on labs to crate text files that would store weather logs for different cities by adding them to a dictionary. 
  After the break out session, there was a workshop on generaive AI and Large Langauge Models (LLM) led by Mr Tandjong. I learned about various LLM such as gpt-4 --used to power chat gpt, Gemini 2.5-- used to power gemini, and claude 3.5 -- for claude. I also learned that LLM aren't coded but trained to run on large sets of data such as wikipedia, academic papers, code, and many more. I also learned the difference between deep learning and machine learning.
  Following the presentation, We were quizzed uisng Kahoot. It was fun because it was like a friendly competition between py 101 and 102.  It was informative, engaging, and fun. We also used AI models to generate music and chats, and it was funny seeing the different things that generative AI can come up with on the spot.
    When the presenattion ended we were sent back to our respective project groups to play a gma eof 'Bot or Not', where we have to guess if the image was generative ai or not. Mr Tandjong as well as several of my peers, and I discussed how to tell the differece between ai generated media and real media so we know how to keep ourselves educated.

  At some point during the 102 session, my code was having issues running.

reflection: |
  Overall, the python 102 session was a good way to practice more of my coding, and the presesnce of my peers made it easier to understand what went wrong with my code. It was also unsettling to see how ai generated ccould be used and how dangerous it could be if not used appropriately. The game of Bot or Not made me question if some of the images i have seen were ai or no. This orientation period has opened my eye to new things and educated me on things i was not aware of previously.
