what_i_learned: |
  I learned something new about myself, my team members, and my cohort. I learned that there were early birds, people who loved blasting music as they were studying, and people who commute long distances. I got to know more about my learning/teaching styles. I found out that i was a multimodal learner, leaning towards Visual, Aural, and Read/Writing, which i find to be true as i retain information if i am able to write it down, see a graphic, or listen to it multiple times. I also took the Myers-Briggs test and ended up with ISTJ-T, the logistician. I would say that I agree with these results as I can tend to be a perfectionist most of the time and can be inflexible when it comes to considering other people's inputs. I also found out 2 other people in my group share the same personality trait with me. It would explain a lot about the current group dynamics, and it made me realize that I would have to take other people's opinions into consideration. AFter we completed the personality tets, we were asked to do a gallery walk around the room soo we could learn more about our cohorts as well as their project and how they aim to include the things that they have learned into it.

  Following that, my team members and I met with Dr. Pelumi in the lab and we discussed our progress on the final paper. We also found out that we had to implement validation accuracy check into the code base as it wasn't there before. Seeing the amound of things that were added to the paper was a little overwhelming, but we should be able to complete the paper in due time. Later that day, Dr. Owolabi, our faculty mentor came to check up on us and asked about our progress wriitng the paper. Aayam suggested that we try running the code base on another dataset to verify the results we were having previously, as they seemed suspicious.

   Trying to write the lit paper. There's a lot to be implemented. It feels overwhelming. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we were able to make progress in the paper. I decided to implement validation accuracy into mobilenetv2 so i could see the results for validation data. Tomorrow, I will try testing out the new dataset to see if there's going to be major difference in the rsults. We will be doing comparative results as it would be too late to change anything in the code base at this time
