what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by making it to the lab at the CBEIS building. I would say that today was a pretty productive day. Dr. Pelumi split us up into sections on how the literature paper will start. It has been interesting so far, seeing the diffrerent ways that many people write about the topic that we've been working on this summer. Over the next three weeks, I will be working with my teammates to finalize our literature paper that will be submitted and presented at the mid summer symposium by the end of this month.  I am looking forward to it to be honest, as i will see the different demonstrations and more indepth presentations of what my cohort has been doing. Right now, Ignatius and I are working together on the literature review section of the paper.

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we will begin compliling our results and findings of the past 7 weeks into a literature paper. I am looking forward to the end of summer symposium. Although it might be nerve wrecking to think about as there will be more people there than at the mid summer symposium, I am looking forward to more information on what my cohort have been doing. I'll also be working with my lab partners on drafting the abstract and literature review section on the final paper.
