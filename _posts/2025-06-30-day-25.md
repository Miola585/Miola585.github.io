what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by checking up on the models that I had left to run overnight. Today I tried using AdamW to fine tune the hyperparameters and implementing weight decay in my model to reduce overfitting. I was also able to test the model and the results were suspiciously high. I was able to discuss this wwith Pelumi and he assured me that this seemed accurate since I had been testing these models for weeks, and I should continue to fine tune it. After running the models I began working on my portion of the mid summer symposium slides and the weekly video.

   Installing AdamW to the colab notebook was very different as it is not in the keras library, so it was a bit of a struggle getting it to work.

reflection: |
  It was very productive in the lab today, I was able to run more models, I am currently running one with 60 epochs. I am very satisfied with the work that I was able to do today. The models that I ran today containing 60 Epochs each and they both gave very high accuracies, precision, recall, and f1 scores. It's a relief that I was able to make more progress after these few weeks. I was also able to work with my group members on the mid summer presentation. I look forward to what I will be able to achieve tommorow.
