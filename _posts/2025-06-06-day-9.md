what_i_learned: |
  Today was a vey productive day for me. I started my day by completing the draft of my literature review. After finishing my report, my lab partners and I gave exchanged feedback on each other's papers, which was really helpful. Once we wrapped up the literature review session, I completed the final lessons of Computer Vision course on Kaggle and succesfully earned my certificate. 
  Later in the day, Mr. Pelumi visited our lab group to inform us about what we'll be working on next week. My lab partners and I made necessary edits to our group slide presentation and mamnged to record our weekly update video. It took us about three tries but we completed it and submitted it on time.

  There were some concepts in the computer vision course that i did not understand, but i was able to watch youtube videos on them and those videos really helped.

reflection: |
  Overall, this week was a great end to my first week in person at CEAMLS, I got a lot of work done and learned new concepts in deep learning and computer vision. I am looking forward to next week where Mr. Pelumi will teach my lap partners and I how to write technical reports on Overleaf, something I am excited to learn about. This has been a very productive and fun week. I was able to meet brand new people in person, got to know people in my cohort, my team members, and mentors.
