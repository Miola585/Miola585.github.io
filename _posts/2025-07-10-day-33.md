what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by making it to the lab at the CBEIS building. I would say that today was a pretty productive day. My team mates and I began working on our final paper. We were able to complete the abstract section and made significant progress on the literature review section. Ignatius and I should be able to add more to that by the end of this week. Today, I found out how abstracts for journals are often written, Dr. Pelumi gave us a break down as to how it is going to be at least for this paper. It was very helpful, and splitting it amongst ourselves made it easier to complete. There will be a writing seminar tomorrow which will go into detail about how research papers should be written

   No Blockers. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we will begin compliling our results and findings of the past 7 weeks into a literature paper. We were able to make progress regarding the literature review and we should be done with the introduction and review section by fridey... minus any obstacles. I look forward to the cohort section tomorrow to learn about research writing.
