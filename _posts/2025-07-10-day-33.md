what_i_learned: |
    Today I began my day by making my way to the business building for the enrichment block. We'll be having Dr Anita Pandey from the writing center coming to speak on technical writing. Dr. Pandey's session was very informative as i learnt new things about her, and about how to write. It was very interesting and captivating. Dr. Pandey broke down the structure of how to write an abstract. She also went into detail about how the introduction of a research paper should be written; with a catchy sentence starter, like a statistic or some form of imagery. Something that would draw the audience in, be it a college student or a professional.

    Following that, we also got to meet the members of the writing center, they introduced themselves and told us where to find them. Dr. Pandey also gave us some tips and tricks that would aid us in writiing our paper, such as using a passive voice in order to maintain credibility. There were many things I was able to take away from this section, and I found it interesting that the use of passive voice is encouraged in journal wriitng. I believe that it might be something that I struggle with, since it is often advised when writing essays that we write in a passive voice. I am finally starting to see the difference in writing essays vs a journal article. I would say that it has been very eye opening this far.

    Furthermore, she encourged the use of plain US english; being able to break down long and complex sentences into simple ones so we can keep our audiences engaged. For this section, we were tasked to work on a catchy title for our paper. I got to hear some very captivating titles from my cohort, titles that if I cam across, I would be eager to read them. My group and I are still struggling a bit on what we should have for our titlle, but I believe that we would be able to  come to an agreement befor next week.

    Armed with new knowledge, I went back to my lab so I could begin implementing the ideas Dr. Pandey provided us with. I was able to create an outline as suggested by many of the individuals from the writing center  and i was able to make signficant progress on the lit review Ignatius and I are working on.

    Today was fun, and I got to learn various new things. I learned the importance of having an outline when you are trying to wrtite as it will save you a lot of time and can even help when one is experiencing writers block. In addition, I also learned that Dr. Pandey could say thank you in 200 different languages. She also taught us how to say them in Hausa, Urdu, and Efik, alongside the guests and one of the ug in the cohort. With this new findings I was able to learn about today, I hope that my group and I can implement them into our paper for the end of summer symposium. Three weeks away. I look forward to what ever else Dr. Pandey will speak on next thursday.
