what_i_learned: |
  I continued writing up the literature review section with my team member, Ignatius. We were able to complete majority of it according to several examples given to us by Dr. Pandey, Aayam, and the literature reviews made accessible to us in the shared drive. Next week we will begin the methodology section as well as discussions about the literature review that we compiled. It is fun trying to draft our own research paper, and I beleive that the session by Dr. Pandey yesterday helped me overcome the inital blocks and problems that came with writing the literature review section and the abstract. I think from now on it should be less difficult as I have a directive I can use as an example. I look forward to what my team and I can acheive next week.

   writing the lit review section. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we will continue compliling our results and findings of the past 8 weeks into a literature paper. We were able to complete the abstract and Introduction section of our paper. Ignatius and I were also able to compile our references so we will just focus on tweaking the lit review section over the weekend so we have more time to focus on the methodology section as it will be the focal point of the paper. I look forward to the completion of our research pper at least before the end of the month.
