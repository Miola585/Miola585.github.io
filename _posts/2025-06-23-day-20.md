what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by making my way to my lab at CBEIS. When I got here, I found out that the air conditioning wasn't functioning, but luckily we had a small fan in our room that allowed it to be habitable. However, we found out that it was dripping water so we had to fix that. We were given the option to move to the business building but were unable to do so because most of our work had to be done locally on the lab computers. Running the code anywhere else would take a lot of time to set up.

  With this problem resolved for now, I began working on running my models. The ones I left running on the weekend unfortunately conuldn't be complted due to a power outage in the building. But that was ok as I noticed that i had made a few errors in defining variables and had to implemennt another call back. I added a Model Checkpoing; what this does is to keep a recod of which model hyperparameter worked best and keep track of it sothe training can resume from where it is saved.

  The heat was a bit of an issue, and I realized that i mistyped a few variables so i had to correct that. My model is overfitting.

reflection: |
  Although it was very productive in the lab today, the heat slowed things down a bit. I took frequent breaks to make sure i don't wear myself out, and I was able to get a little bit done. I continued documenting my findings about MobileNetV2 trainings that I was running, but i still have the issue of the model overfitting during training so i will be implementing checkpoints and increasing the drop out rates. I want to see what I will be able to acheive tommorow as well.
