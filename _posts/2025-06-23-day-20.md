what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very overwhelming day. As soon as I got to the lab, I began setting up my work stattion to start running and training my models. I changed up the hyperparameters to see if the accuracy would improve compared to yesterday. I tried running multiple models at a time, and i found that it was very stressful. I changed the optimizers from Adam to SGD. I found that SGD also, Stochastic Gradient Descent had a lot of arguments included. I went to Keras to learn more about the optimizers and also callbacks. 

  For my models today, I implemented early stopping and also ReluOnPlateau. Both of these callbacks monitored the validation loss and made sure to stop training the model if the validation loss is no longer decreasing. I am yet to see different results as they are very similar with prior runnings. I also added image augumentations to the training data buy rotating, zooming and shifting the images.

   I also researched on what each of the arguments in each callback and optimizer meant. I made sure to document my changes so i do not get lost or confused on what i had previously changed, and I found that it was very helpful. After running the models, I began working on my slide for this weeks' video recording.

  Running 4 diffrent models at once was very overwhelming as I had to keep switching between different tabs to find the model that was running but documenting my changes was very helpful.

reflection: |
  Although it was very productive in the lab today, it was also very intese. I learned that documentation of research is very important because it helps you to keep track of little changes as well as very important ones. By Monday, I will continue working on the training and evaluating the model that has been assigned to me and documenting my findings. I am also very happy that we are keeping up with our project plan up till this week. It has been very satisfying to make progress no matter how little.
