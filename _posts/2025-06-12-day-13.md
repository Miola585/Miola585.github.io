what_i_learned: |
  Today was pretty fun, especially the SAIRI cohort connect. We got to play a game of taboo and Jenga, and it was amusing seeing the competitiveness between group 1 and group 2. I had never played Taboo before, and being introduced to it was very interesting. It was a game that enhances communication skills among the students, and tested my knowledge on how many words i could or couldn't use to describe something.

  Following that, we had an enrichment session where we were introduced to how to use overleaf. At first I didn't understand it, but Michael was able to break it down . I learned about the commands for adding new sections and subsections, as well as making a new paragraph and newline. I hope to be able to learn more about it. After the enrichment session and lunch, I made my way back to the lab to resume training my model.

  Overall, I would say that today was a really productive day, I was able to complete the trainings for efficient net v1 and v2, B0. It was also fun engaging in friendly competitions with my cohort, and I am actually looking forward to the enrichment blocks.
