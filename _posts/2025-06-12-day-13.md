what_i_learned: |
  Today was pretty fun, especially the SAIRI cohort connect. We got to play a game of taboo and Jenga, and it was amusing seeing the competitiveness between group 1 and group 2. I had never played Taboo before, and being introduced to it was very interesting. It was a game that enhances communication skills among the students, and tested my knowledge on how many words i could or couldn't use to describe something.

  Following that, we had an enrichment session where we were introduced to how to use overleaf. At first I didn't understand it, but Michael was able to break it down . I learned about the commands for adding new sections and subsections, as well as making a new paragraph and newline. I hope to be able to learn more about it.
  
  After the enrichment session and lunch, I made my way back to the lab to resume training my model. Dr. Pelumi came to check up on us and to see how far we have been doing today, and made us aware of the deliverable for the end of this week. When I ran EfficientNetB0, I found that the accuracy was very low compared to the other versions we had been using, DenseNet and MobileNet; My team members and I got the exact confusion matrix and the accuracy scores were ~0.5's, which was very interesting.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Overall, I would say that today was a really productive day, I was able to complete the trainings for efficient net v1 and v2, B0. It was also fun engaging in friendly competitions with my cohort, and I am actually looking forward to the enrichment blocks. Dr Pelumi also informed us that we will be going over the basics and summary for each of the individual models, and we will be quizzed on them.  We will finally be able to choose which models will go into our ensemble model. Tommorow, I will ask Dr. Pelumi why that is, and if we will be using this for our ensemble model.
