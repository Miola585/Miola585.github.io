  Today was a productive day in the lab; I was able to complete my research on MobileNet V1 and V2, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet. I was also able to complete running DenseNet again with more epochs this time to see the accuracy. I compared my result to Yusrah and Ignatius' output, and the final results were extremely similar. We were able to report this to Mr. Pelumi, who told us that we would have to tune the model hyperparameters in order to improve the overall accuracy.

  Following that, I was able to work on the model structure for EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetV2B0, However, I was unable to run it as the current model I am training (MobileNet V1) is taking a lot of time. While it was running in the background, I found time to read on the other articles for the model. Hopefully by tommorow, I will be able to run at least the EfficientNetB0 Model as it is due by the end of this week. If any of these models can't provide an accurate result, we will be looking for other models that can complete this task.

  Trying to run the models takes a lot of time due to the GPU on google colab being limited.

  Overall, I would say that today was a really productive day, I hope to accomplish the tasks given to me on this project tommorow. Although I was able to get some work done, today really showed me what running models would look like. It takes a really long time, and I can't imagine having to wait for hours to complete a task. This has made me gain new found respect for people who dedicate their time to research that improves lives and society as a whole.
