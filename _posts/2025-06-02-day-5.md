what_i_learned: |
  Today truly marks the beginning of my onternship her at CEAMLS. It started with the re-introductions of the Program directors, faculty mentors, graduate mentors, and my peers. I finally got to meet Dr Nyarko, Mrs. Gabrielle Waters, Dr. Naja Mack, and Mr Adeleke inperson. I also got to meet ny team members, as well as other students in my cohort. Needless to say, it has been an eventful day.

  After introdcutions, we learned about the institute and what CEAMLS stands for, and aims to do. Mrs Gabrielle Waters also led us through an interactive session where we learned more about AI and how it could be trained. She led us hrough what Independent and dependent variables are. We also learned about RAG (Retreival-Augumented Generation), and how AI can be Non-deterministic. AI being Non-deterministic means that it will not give the same results when it is being prompted to, each person might have a different result when using different AI systems.

  Following the AI overview, my team and I engaged in a team building activity where we had to use pasta and tape to build the longest and stable tower, strong enough to hold a marshmallow. For privacy purposes, the result of that challenge will be kept hidden :) .

  After the introductory session completed, my group and I went to our labs and began our first assignment for the week -- reveiwing research journals and conference papers, to see how other reseachers conducted their work and the methods they used while conducting their project.

  A blocker today was figuring out how my team and I could hold up the marshmallow with the spaghetti noodles and tape, while working with limited time

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a very productive day. I got to meet my team members in person and got to know how each person worked. I was also able to get some work done: I managed to finish 1 conference paper and made it through half of a journal. I expect to pick up from here tommorow. It was also interesting to learn how the training of ai models worked.
