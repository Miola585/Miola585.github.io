what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by continuing to work on the powerpoint slides for the midsummer presentation. I was able to complete my slides for my personal accomplishments. Now I have to work on the slides that have been assigned to me by my group mentor alongside my team members. Since I didn't spend much of my time in the lab due to appointments that I had to make, I would say that I was able to successfully finish the task that has been assigned to me today.

  Furthermore, I was able to implement Optuna, a framework that helps with optimization of the model by searching for the best combination of values that shows that thet model is functioning properly, my teammate Ayam helped me with this. I will see the result soon depending on how fast the local gpu will run.

   Learning about Optuna. 

reflection: |
  It was very productive in the lab today, I was able to run more models, I am currently running one with 60 epochs on optuna with 30 trials. In total that would be 1800 epochs. I am very satisfied with the work that I was able to do today. . I was also able to continue work with my group members on the mid summer presentation. I look forward to what I will be able to achieve tommorow.
