what_i_learned: |
  I began working on my mid-summer presentation with my group members. So far, I have completed the slides assigned to me, which cover several key topics related to our project. However, we still need to review the slides for any grammatical errors and make necessary changes. Neah has kindly offered to assist us with this editing process, ensuring that everything is polished and professional. In addition to proofreading, we need to create our demo video. I plan to work on that tonight.

  Later in the day, Dr. Pelumi joined us to discuss the content of our slides. During this meeting, we brainstormed ideas for improvements to our presentation. We also assigned specific members to present each slide on Thursday, so everyone knows their responsibilities. Unfortunately, we had to wrap up our meeting early due to the unpredictable weather, which was becoming quite severe. On a separate note, my Optuna trial is still running. I suspect it might complete on Friday or possibly sometime next week, depending on how the optimization progresses. Overall, it’s been a productive day, and I’m looking forward to finalizing our presentation and demo video for thursday!

  Today was productive, as I completed my assigned slides and collaborated with my team on improvements. Dr. Pelumi's feedback provided valuable insights that will enhance our presentation. I’m excited about creating the demo video, which will showcase our project effectively. Although the weather posed challenges, I’m hopeful that my Optuna trial will yield results soon.
