what_i_learned: |
  Today began with an  Overleaf session hosted by Michael at the Business building. He taught ushow o add new files and sections to the overleaf document. We also improved the authorship names section on the paper and the title as well. It was a great session and I found it eady to transfer all that my group and I had written so far. When I got back to my lab, I started working on transferring the literature review table wr had worked on. It was my first time making a table on overleaf, it was tedious at first but a YouTube video helped with the process as well as the overleaf tutorial website. I was able to transfer 84% of all the info we had on our draft. I will be able to complete this tomorrow .

   Creating a table on overleaf. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a stressful day. Together with Neah, we were also able to consolidate our abstract and introduction so it is finalized and we know wr have something tangible to work with. I also tried Densenet on the similar codebase and it was very very suspicious. I will have to take a look at it next  week with my mentor so we know what is going on. We will begin the methodology section next week and combine the results we have so far.
