what_i_learned: |
  I began my day by reviewing what I had written on the literature review section and related works. I realized that what I had typed there fit more into the discussion section than the related works, so I had to make a lot of changes. Dr Pelumi and Dr. Owolabi came to check up on us and to see what we had on our paper so far.
  I tried using Densenet on the codebase that I had previously to see if the results that I had been getting over the padt couple of weeks were correct as it seemed really suspicious... very suspicious in fact with almost perfect validation accuracy. Using Densenet also gave very similar results so I know something is definitely wrong somewhere. However, I will have to look over this next week. 

blockers: |
   Something in my codebase is definitely malfunctioning as the results are too perfect. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a stressful day. Together with Neah, we were also able to consolidate our abstract and introduction so it is finalized and we know wr have something tangible to work with. I also tried Densenet on the similar codebase and it was very very suspicious. I will have to take a look at it next  week with my mentor so we know what is going on. We will begin the methodology section next week and combine the results we have so far.
