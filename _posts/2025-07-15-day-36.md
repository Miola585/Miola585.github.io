what_i_learned: |
  I started my day by completeing the literature review as well as the discussion section of the final paper. I was experiencing a writers block in the discussion section, but taking a break and coming back helped my thoughts flow better. I alo began taking a look at several templates available on the overleaf websit to get an idea of how journal articles are written on there. I found that there were several ways and began to realize that we had our work cut ou for us when we begin transferring our write ups to overleaf. I believe that that is a a struggle we can overcome when we get to that section, but for now my group members and I will continue with our google doc. The rest of this week will be dedicated to finalize fine tuning the model so we can compile our data in the results and evaluation sections. Additionally, I learnt how to write out references on overleaf. At first I thought that each refernce would have to be numbered, but with the youtube video i watched and the documentation from the overleaf website, it was very different.

   Experienced writers block while writing the discussion section. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a very productive day, we were able to make significant progress in the paper. Dr. Pelumi also let us know that any more manipulations of the codebase will have to end this week so we can begin compiling our results and findings. I also began taking a look at different oveleaf templates as well as the samples provided by our graduate mentor. I look forward to how much progress i can make on this tommorow.
