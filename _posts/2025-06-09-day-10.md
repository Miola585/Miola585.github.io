  There were some concepts in the computer vision course that i did not understand, but i was able to watch youtube videos on them and those videos really helped.

reflection: |
  Overall, this week was a great end to my first week in person at CEAMLS, I got a lot of work done and learned new concepts in deep learning and computer vision. I am looking forward to next week where Mr. Pelumi will teach my lap partners and I how to write technical reports on Overleaf, something I am excited to learn about. This has been a very productive and fun week. I was able to meet brand new people in person, got to know people in my cohort, my team members, and mentors.
