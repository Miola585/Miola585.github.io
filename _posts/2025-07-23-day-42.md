what_i_learned: |
  Today began with me editing the literature review at the lab. Aayam and I worked together to refine the table on Overleaf so it looked more structured and professional. Tomorrow, we will all be working on completing the methodology section and finally transferring everything to the official overleaf document. Following that, we decided to film our elevator pitch for the end of the summer symposium. Our idea was to film in a car and transition to show our model. It was fun getting to work with my group members to film the video. Tomorrow, Yusrat and I will be editing the video and finalizing everything so it's ready by Thursday. Ignatius had a cool idea of combining the original dataset with the nthuddd for one of the models, and it gave interesting results. With this, I will be trying it out on MobileNet to see how it would go.

    Overall, today was a fun day. We got to record our video for the ad of the symposium, and it was really interesting. I also got good results from trying out ignatius' idea and I will be seeing the rseults of that tomorrow. By the end of this week we will also be finalizing our methodology for the paper.
