what_i_learned: |
  My team and I finally finshed up the methodology section. We still need to modify and polish a few things. This will be done tommorow with the help of our graduate mentor, Dr Pelumi, and our high school teacher, Eneah. I am very excited about thw progress we made today, and it feels tha we are finally nearing the end of the paper. We still have the results section to finalize, this will mostly likely be done by next week. After, I completed the optuna section in the methodology; I'll have Neah look over it alongside the rest of the paper so we can polish up any mistakes or misspellings before the final transfer. Following that Yusrah and I took a look at the video edits that she made, I would say that she did a really good job with it. It was so eciting to see the final product.

reflection: |
    Today was a really productive day. My team and I finally got to complete the methodology setion of the paper. By the end of this week, we will begin compiling the results from previous models and write that section on the final paper. With the help of Neah and Dr. Pelumi, we will begin refining the methodology section tomorrow so we can check for any errors. I would say that that has been the most challenging thing of the paper so far and now that we have completed it, it will be smooth sailing from here. I am excited to see all that we will accomplish before the end of dummer symposium.
