what_i_learned: |
  Today began with an  Overleaf session hosted by Michael at the Business building. He taught us how to add new files and sections to the overleaf document. We also improved the authorship names section on the paper and the title as well. It was a great session and I found it eady to transfer all that my group and I had written so far. When I got back to my lab, I started working on transferring the literature review table wr had worked on. It was my first time making a table on overleaf, it was tedious at first but a YouTube video helped with the process as well as the overleaf tutorial website. I was able to transfer 84% of all the info we had on our draft. I will be able to complete this tomorrow .

   Creating a table on Overleaf. 

reflection: |
    Overall, today was a stressful day. The overleaf session by Michael was incredibly helpful and easy to follow. We also refined title and authorship of the paper. The main challenge was transferring the table from google docs to overleaf, but i was able to overcome it by watching YouTube videos. I feel more confident in using overleaf now.
