what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about what git and github was. It was a full session taught by Clyde Tandjong. At first I taught that it would be complicated and stressful, but Mr Tandjong broke it up to make it easy.

  I learned about various git commands, how important it is to commit changes made to the file in order to preserve your work, as well as the issues one might encounter if you are working together with multiple people.

  During the breakout session with my group, I was told that there would be a placement test. At first I was worried that it would be stressful and hard, but when i got to it, I found that it was to test my knowledge. 

  Moreover, I got to meet the members of my group and get to know the people that I would be working with this summer. During the session, I was also involved in speed networking where i got to know the other undergraduate researchers by playing bingo with them. It was very fun seeing and hearing the things i had in common with the people in CEAMLS.
