what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about what git and github was. It was a full session taught by Clyde Tandjong. At first I taught that it would be complicated and stressful, but Mr Tandjong broke it up to make it easy.

  I learned about various git commands, how important it is to commit changes made to the file in order to preserve your work, as well as the issues one might encounter if you are working together with multiple people.

blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to finally learn abot git and github since i had being learning a lot about it. Overall it was really exciting to learn new things and get to know my peers and mentors.
