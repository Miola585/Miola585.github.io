  Today was a productive day. I took a look at the new dataset, the NTHUDDD, that we will begin using to verify the results of the previous models. Although the dataset incorporates multiple facial expressions, it isn't as diverse as the previous datset as it only focuses on one ethnic group. However, the images are greyscale which differs from the original, and might be good to consider for night time driving conditions. I tried running the dataset and made changes to the folder names but they kept giving me errors and saying that images were found in 3 classes as opposed to 2. I fixed the issue as i noticed that there were 3 subfolders in the split data directory. Following that, I was able to work on the literature reviw section of the paper, I found that I had been using active voice and 'our' a lot in this section and that has to be fixed

   Trying to write the lit paper. There's a lot to be implemented. It feels overwhelming.

    Overall, today was a very productive day, we were able to make progress in the paper. I tried testing out the new dataset on the mobilenetv2 codebase today. Although the dataset isnt as diversified as the original one provide to us, it gives the model something new to train on. I'm trying to train it at least twice. The first result gave me a 91% average overall; to improve it, I unfroze the last 50 layers of the model to see if the accuracy would be higher. However, I will not be able to see the results until tommorow.
