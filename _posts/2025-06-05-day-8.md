what_i_learned: |
  I started today by taking a walk around campus. Mrs. Waters and Mr Adeleke led my cohort on a campus tour. Today, I learned that the stomes with the names on them in the quad are of people who have made significant contributions to morgan state university as a whole.


  Although it was very tiring due to the heat, it was interesting to learn about something new. The tour started form the Earl Graves business school, and ended at the school of architecture and planning.
  

  After the tour and lunch, my group and I met in our lab room to continue the work that we had been assigned. We managed to get a monitor to display after struggling for a few days to understand what was wrong with it. We discovered that the display cable for one of the monitors had been connected to one another instead of the CPU.
  

  With the issue resolved, we worked on our group powerpoint and managed to complete it before the end of the day, and I also managed to complete 3 topics on my Computer Vision course

  While I was reading abut paddings and strides for the CV course, I had trouble visualizing how it works. However, Aayam was able to provide me with a website where i could visualize what was happening in real time. During the tour, I also forgot to take a water bottle with me.

reflection: |
  Overall, I would say that today was a bit tiring but, it was really exciting to learn something new. It was also very fulfilling to have been able to come together with my group to fix an issue that someone was struggling with. This gives me an insight into how we will be working together in the coming weeks. 
  Unfortunately, I didn't reallly get to work on my review paper, but i hope to complete it and my CV course before the end of tommorrow.
