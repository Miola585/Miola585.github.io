what_i_learned: |
  Today was aproductive day at the lab. I continued my readings on the research papers provided by our graduate mentor, Dr. Pelumi, and I was given the task of writing a 3-4 page summary on the notes i took while reading the paper. it is to be truned in before the end of this week. When I am done with the summary paper, I will meet with my group members to discuss the common denominator or problem in the papers that we have all read. This marks the beginning of our project where we have to develop a pipeline for the upcoming work. 

  Moreover, I was able to complete my certificaation for the deep learning course that I had beun to learn this week. I learned a lot of new words and concepts such as , underfitting and over fitting, the purpose of a batch normalization, epochs, binary cross entropy, dropout, and much more. I was also able to begin the next course on Computer Vision, and I have managed to complete 2 topics so far, I hope to continue learning more on this tommorrow. 

  Dr Pelumi also showed us the ml/dl model we will be working with called, MobilenetV2, as well as the other models we will be building an ensemble on: densenet121, and effficientB0. Although it is unknown if we will expand the models that we will be using, these three are what out project will be based around on.

reflection: |
  Overall, I would say that today was a really productive day, and I was able to learn a lot of new topics, concepts, and words that i was not familiar with. Although these are very new concepts to me, I hope that my continuation into these topics will expand my knowlede of Deep learning models. So far, I would say that learning about machine learning, deep learing and computer vision concepts has been fun overall, and I am looking forward to many more of the things my group and I will accomplish in the upcoming weeks
