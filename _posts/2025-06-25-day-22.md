what_i_learned: |
  Today started after I made my way to my lab to resume model training, as is the goal for this week. I tried rerunning the original code base to see if there was going to be a difference compared to the changes I made, but there wasn't. The accuracy of the model stands at 50%, but I was able to run a diffrent one that gave me 53%, which is a very very small improvement. I will also try to run another on the google colab gpu to see if there will be a diffrence using the Lion optimizer. 

  The problem with the Lion optimizer is that it doesn't work on the local run so I might have to do it on google colab, but there's a limit to the gpu so I ill have to run on a small number of epochs, but hopefully it will yield better results. I will try this tommorow. I was also able to start drafting what would be on my powerpoint for the mid summer symposium now in july.

   My model is still overfitting despite my best efforts.

reflection: |
  It was very productive in the lab today, I was able to run more models, I am currently running one with 60 epochs. I tried going back to the original codebase to see if there was something that I was missing and why my model keeps overfitting, but alas I couldn't really see any issues. I will ask my mentor to look over it to tell me if I have made a wrong turn somewhere. I look forward to the progress I will make tommorow.
