what_i_learned: |
  Today started after I made my way to the business building where I met with my cohorts and Dr. Mack. She informed us of the expectations for the rest of the summer program, and soothed our mind about the 1st paychecks. We also discussed about our graduate mentors', faculty mentors', and high school teachers' roles in this program.

  Following that, my team and I made it back to our labs despite the excessive heat..., but the A/C in CBEIS is now functioning again so working today was much easier. When I got back to my lab I realized that the training I ran since yesterday hadn't been finished after 17 hours... crazy. It was a bit frustrating, but it completed when I came back from my lunch break.

  I was able to start training more instances by adding l2 regularization and switching out the loss used in the model. I will see the result of that tommorow. While training, Dr. Pelumi checked up on us and we discussed what we would be doing for the mid-summer symposium, and we divided the work for the slides among each other. I will begin working on my slide tommowrow along with my team members. Yusrah, Ignatius, and I also found ways to improve the run time issues we were having with our workstations

blockers: |
   My model is still overfitting despite my best efforts.

reflection: |
  It was very productive in the lab today, I was able to tweak a few things. I was able to include checkpoints, dropout rate, and l2 regulariization. Althogh my model is still overfitting, this blocker reminds me that research isn't always going to be perfect, it isn't always going to give you the result you want; which is why I have mentors and peers who i can go to in time of help. I look forward to tommorow's results .
