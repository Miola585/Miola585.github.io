what_i_learned: |
  My day began when i arrived at the business building for the Sairi Enrichment Block. Dr Mack Discussed her expectations for us over the next 6 weeks and how we could improve workflow. Following that, my team and I came together to make a 30 second guessing game to introduce ourselves to the High school teacher that wil be joining us for the rest of the summer. We then played a survival game called lost at sea where we were given a list of things that we would have with us if were stranded in the middle of the sea. Suprisingly, according to the coast guard, the most important thing to have would be a mirror because it could allow you to reflect light to catch the attention of whoever might be close by. That was very surprising because my team members and I had a fishing kit first, but the coast guard believe that it should come in 9th because there's a low probabiltiy of catching fishes... in the ocean. 

  After that, we got to meet the high school teacher who will be participating in this program with us, Ms. Eneah Fite, or Neah as she would like to be called. Neah was able to guess our project name correctly from the 30 second pitch. For the Icebreaker section, we played a game called soundtrack of my life where we had to pick three songs, one that represented our childhoo, one from high school years, and one to represent where we are now, and give a reason why we chose the songs. Mine were Pray for me by Darey, Way Less Sad by AJR, and Are You Satisfied by Marina. I won't be elaborating on that :)

  After Lunch, I went back to the lab and began working on training the models. I was finally able to run it locally using anaconda and jupyter notebook. It took a while to set up because i don't really understand much about either of these programs, but i was able to search up anaconda cheat sheet to get my environment up and running. I was still running into some errors but i kept messing around, uninstalling and reinstalling different packages but i was able to get it to work and run the code locally.

  Unable to run the code locally because i was getting a 404 error that i didn't understand but fixed it by searching up the meaning of the error and reinstalling needed packages.

reflection: |
  I would consider today a productive and fun day. It was really interesting when we played the lost at sea, and how each group would rank the items that they would have, and comparing it to that of the coast guard. Needless to say, I might be able to survive on a raft, as long as there are no sharks. It was also nice to meet Neah and introduce her to what we had been doing so far. I look forward to working with her over the next few weeks.
