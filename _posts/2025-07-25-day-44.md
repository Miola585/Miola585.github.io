what_i_learned: |
  Today began with a meeting with our graduate mentor. Dr. Pelumi came to check on what we had done so far and give us a rundown of how the rest of the week is going to go. Today, we tried to deploy our individual models onto hugging face to see if they work as perfectly as claimed. At first, it was difficult to deploy as I didn't understand how it would go from an IPython notebook to the Hugging Face space. But with research, i found out that I had to save the model training with an .h5 or keras file it could be deployed. However, Yusrat, Ignatius, and I were able to figure it out, and we got most of the models deployed and they seem to be working accurately althoug they utiolize images instaed of real time video. Finally, we finished editing the video for our elevator pitch and turned it in.

reflection: |
    Today was a really productive day. My team and I finally got to deploy our model on Hugging Face. At first, we struggled to understand how we could build the app, but we worked together and also accessed youtube videos so it could be mode seamless. We will begin writing out the result section for the paper tomorrow, alongside Neah. I look forward to the guest speaker from the University of Alabama tomorrow.
