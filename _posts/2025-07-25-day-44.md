what_i_learned: |
  Dr Crawford was a guest speaker here to day and I learned about different between human interactions with computer and robots. He spoke on the new innovation of using brain waves to control drones or robots. He also discussed several of his papers that had been published over the years, as well as his starting of the Human-Technology Innovation Lab. I also learned that the first Human Brain-Tech interaction was founded/discovered in the 1960s. I discovered that the HTIL lab had developed software that would be able to read muscle energy in order to control a robot. Following that, we got to experiment with several of the robots provided by Dr Crawford and his team. We got to control a robot with muscle energy from our hand, and we also got to control drones with our brain muscles by either clenching our hand or our jaws. It was really fun learning about Brain-Computer Interfaces and how they can be utilized.

    Today was a really fun day. I got to learn more about Neuroscopy and Neuroblock from Dr. Crawford and his team. After that, my team and I made our way back to our lab to continue working on our research paper. Yusrat and I worked together to make sure our methodology pipeline was properly inserted into the paper and properly formatted to avoid errors. Dr Pelumi needs us to complete the paper and presentation by Wednesday.
