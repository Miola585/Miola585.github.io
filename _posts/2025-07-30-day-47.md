what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very productive day. We completed the results section of the paper. Dr. Pelumi will be working to get this submitted to a TRB conference. We also managed to finish up our presentation for the end of the summer symposium tomorrow. This will be the last time working at the lab. It's safe to say that i will be missing this place as well as the people working here. It was a fun and exciting summer and I am glad to have gained more experience in the field of AI.

reflection: |
    Today was a milestone in our journey.  As I reflect on this experience, I realize how much I’ll miss the lab and my colleagues. This summer has been filled with excitement and invaluable lessons in AI, and I'm thankful for every moment spent here. It's bittersweet to say goodbye, but I leave with a wealth of knowledge and cherished memories. I look forward to the symposium tomorrow.
