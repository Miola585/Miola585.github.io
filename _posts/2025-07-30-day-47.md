what_i_learned: |
  Today was a very productive day. We are almost done with our paper, except the result discussion and conclusion, wwhich we willl be taking a look at tomorrow. We also had Dr. Pandey come in to review our paper and go over our abstract. It was said that we need to review and make some changes to make it better. Following that, we had a meeting with Dr. Pelumi to talk about how the discussion section would go and got tips for it. Hopefully, tomorrow we will be able to finally complete that and be doen with the paper.

reflection: |
    Today was a productive day. Although short, the session with Dr. Pandey was incredibly helpful, and we got to see the areas of the paper that can be improved upon before we turn it in. Things are finally winding down and the summer program is almost over. By tomorrow, we should be done with our paper and the slides for the end of the summer symposium.
