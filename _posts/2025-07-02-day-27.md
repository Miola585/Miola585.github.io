what_i_learned: |
  My Optuna model finally finished running by the time i got to the lab this morning. It gave me the learning rate as well as the dropout rate that will be produce better results with the Adam optimizer. After I got the results, I tried running it with the new learning rate and drop out value provided to me, and for the first time, I was able to see stellar results with the Adam and AdamW optimizer. Adam gave me better results with little to no mis classification in the confusion matrix display. I was very happy with this and shared the results with my team members. 

  Following that, Dr. Pelumi came to check up on our presentation for tomorrow, to practice with us once again and see our demo video. At this time, Yusrah and I had been editing the video by combining all the submission into one video. It was very stressful as it felt like we were rushing. I hadn't even been stressed as much at the beginning of the day. However, we were able to submit the video before the deadline, and i think it came out pretty good. We were going over the time limit when practicing our presentation but we condensed the time even though it felt like we were going through the slides in a rush. I believe that we are somewhat prepared for tomorrow, and any details can be finalized later.

   Rehearsing our presentation felt rushed and it made me anxious. I kept mixing up the words on my slide. 

reflection: |
    This morning, my Optuna model provided optimal learning and dropout rates, leading to impressive results with the Adam optimizer. I was excited to share these findings with my team, but the stress of editing our demo video quickly set in as we rushed to meet the deadline. Although we managed to submit it on time, our practice felt hurried, which made me a bit anxious. Despite this, I believe we are mostly prepared for tomorrow's presentation and can finalize any remaining details later.
