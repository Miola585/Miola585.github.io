   No Blockers. 

reflection: |
  Today was productive, as I completed my assigned slides and collaborated with my team on improvements. Dr. Pelumi's feedback provided valuable insights that will enhance our presentation. I’m excited about creating the demo video, which will showcase our project effectively. Although the weather posed challenges, I’m hopeful that my Optuna trial will yield results soon.
