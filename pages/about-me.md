  bio: |
    I’m currently a rising sophomore studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work involves creating a syetem that can help detect drowsiness in drivers in order to reduce the number of car accidents.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games and reading novels.
