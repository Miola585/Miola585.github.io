project_title: "Non-Contact AI-Drowsiness Detection System for Safe Driving"

problem: |
  Driver drowsiness is a critical issue contributing to accidents, severe crashes, and fatalities on highways. Existing solutions often require physical contact or are not efficient enough for real-time monitoring. There is a need for a non-contact, reliable system that can accurately detect driver drowsiness and provide timely alerts.


approach: |
  The project inclues creating and enhancing:

  - Image and Video Collection and Analysis: Use cameras to capture video feeds of the driverâ€™s face and eye movements. Employ computer vision to analyze the collected images and videos for signs of drowsiness
  - Deep Learning Predicitve Model: Using Machine Learning Algorithms to develop predicitve models and detect drowsiness.
  - Real-Time Monitoring Systems: Using real time monitoring system to capture video feeds of the driver. This system will process images and videos to detect early drowsiness and trigger an alert
  - Alert System: Develop an alert system to alert driver through audio cues when signs of drowsiness are detected
  

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result develop a functional Non-Contact AI-Based drowsiness detection system. This project aims to develop an effective alert system that will utilize image and video analysis, machine and deep learning models, and real time monitoring to detect drowsiness in drivers. By implementing this system, this project will ensure driver safety and reduce the risk of drowsiness related accidents.
